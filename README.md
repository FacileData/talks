# Overview

This repository holds presentation materials used for seminars about FacileData.

The FacileData ecosystem (aka the "facileverse") is a set of R packages
built to make the analysis and exploration of large, consortia-scale genomic
datasets more fruitful for computational and non-computational biologists, 
alike. 

This is accomplished by providing an ecosystem of packages which:

1. Defines a fluent data query and retrieveal API for multi-omics datasets,
   such as the diversity of data generated by the [TCGA][tcga].
2. An efficient (in memory and speed) reference implementation of data
   container that implements the FacileData API (a FacileDataSet). This casn
   easily store the entirety of the high throughput genomics data (RNA-seq,
   microarray, CNV, etc) generated from the ~11,000 samples in the TCGA.
3. A set of common analyses over these data (PCA, differential expression,
   GSEA, etc.) implemented using the FacileData API (FacileAnalyses).
4. A set of [modularized][modules], interactive (shiny) components that can
   query,  retrieve, and display data from a container that implements the
   FacileData API.
5. A set of interactive (shiny) components that can drive analyses and
   present their results interactively. Results can be displayed within
   the context of a shiny app, or as an interactive htmlwidget an Rmarkdown
   report.

Importantly, the interactive components built here can all be weaved together
into a shiny application that is completely driven by a point-and-click
interface, or can individually be invoked as [shiny gadgets][gadget] during
an analysis that is conducted in an interactive R sesssion by an analyst.

We plan to open source these tools in the second half of 2019.

# Talks

## 2017-plotcon

This was the first public debut of FacileData, given on May 3, 2017 at
[PLOTCON][plotcon]. We outlined the need for tools that enable better
collaboration between biologists and computational biologists, and showcased how
the `FacileDataSet` and a `FacileExplorer` shiny application serves this
purpose.

The [video of this talk][plotconvideo] has been [posted to YouTube][plotconvideo].
